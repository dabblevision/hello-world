# hello-world
My first repository. Used to test and learn git and github features.

I'm supposed to write about myself here, but seeing as this is a public repository and I have yet to decide what fake identity I'll assume for this account I'm not going to do that.


I'm trying out the git-plus package for atom now. This is my change, and I'll try to commit and push it now.
